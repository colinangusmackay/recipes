# Granny's Shortbread

This is my granny's shortbreak recipe. It was always a favourite of mine as a child and I would often rush to her shortbread tin any time we visited.

## Before you start

You will need:
* A large mixing bowl
* A table knife
* A baking tray
* An airtight storage container.

## Ingredients

* 200g plain flour
* 100g butter + extra for greasing the baking tray
* 50g castor sugar

## Instructions

1. Mix the flour and sugar together
2. Cut the butter in to pieces
3. Using fingertips rub the butter into the flour/sugar mixture until evenly distributed (almost like bread crumbs)
4. Knead the mixture together into a short, but not sticky, dough.
5. Divide the mixture and shape into rounds about 1cm thick
6. Place rounds on greased baking trays
7. Bake at 160Â°C for about 45 minutes until the shortbread is a pale golden colour.
8. Cool before storing in an air tight container.

## Notes

Instead of rounds, the mix can be spread out over a rectangular tray and cut into fingers after baking but before cooling.
